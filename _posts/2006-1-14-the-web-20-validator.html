The dudes at <a href="http://www.30secondrule.com/">30 second rule</a> have coded this very kool consensual <a href="http://web2.0validator.com/">web 2.0 validator</a>. You can add your own rule via a del.icio.us bookmark.

I have added a rule to check for .rail extensions which would indicate use of the <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/MonoRail">MonoRail </a> engine.

MonoRail is an open source MVC framework for .NET inspired in the successful Ruby on Rails. Recently i have started using MonoRail in one of my company's projects and have found it a very productive framework that promotes simplicity and separation of concerns. After being introduced to it you will find that the Webforms idea is actually bloated and introduces too much complexity.
