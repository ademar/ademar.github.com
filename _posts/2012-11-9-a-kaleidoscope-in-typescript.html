<style>
      #ctrl { margin: 5px; }
</style>
<div style="float:right;margin:10px;">
<div id="kal"></div>
<div id="ctrl"></div>
</div>

Having nothing better to do I've taken TypeScript and Cloud9 IDE for a ride and coded this little kaleidoscope for your amusement.<br /><br />

The code can be found on <a href="https://c9.io/ademar/kaleidoscope">Cloud9 IDE</a> or forked on <a href="https://github.com/ademar/kaleidoscope">GitHub</a>.
<br /><br />
Haven't tested it yet on Microsoft Internet Explorer but seems to work fine on Safari, Chrome and Firefox *.
<br /><br />
Regarding TypeScript I really appreciate the syntax and type checking which it brings to JavaScript world. Anyone who has had to deal with large JavaScript code will see the benefits.
<br /><br />
About Cloud9 IDE I've found it very convenient to use while on the road without access to my IDE of choice; the integration with GitHub is also a plus.
<br /><br />
*Update: It works fine on IE 9
